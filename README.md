# A11Y Drawer: A Universal Accessibility Settings Component

The A11y Drawer is a versatile, user-friendly component designed to empower website and application users with the ability to dynamically adjust multiple accessibility settings. This project aims to create a robust and highly customizable solution that enhances inclusivity by providing immediate control over common accessibility preferences directly within the user interface.

## Available Scripts

- `yarn dev`: Runs the development server for the web demo.
- `yarn build`: Builds the component for production, optimizing for the best performance and creating the distributable package.

<!-- ## Vision & Phases

This project will evolve through strategic phases, culminating in a powerful, cross-platform accessibility package:

1.  **Phase 1: Core Web Component Development:** We'll focus on building a highly functional and customizable accessibility drawer for web applications using modern web standards. This phase includes implementing a foundational set of accessibility adjustments (like font size, contrast, dark mode, reduced motion, and cursor size) and ensuring a seamless user experience that adheres to WCAG guidelines.

2.  **Phase 2: Universal Web Package (NPM/Module):** Once the core component is stable, we'll package it into an easily importable and distributable library (e.g., an NPM package). This phase will prioritize clear documentation and examples for integration into various web frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS), along with modularity, performance, and maintainability for broad adoption.

3.  **Phase 3: React Native Expansion:** The final phase involves developing a parallel, equally powerful package specifically tailored for React Native applications. We'll adapt core accessibility functionalities to the mobile environment, considering platform-specific capabilities and user interactions, aiming for a consistent user experience and feature set across both web and mobile platforms. -->
